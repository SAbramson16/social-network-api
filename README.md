# social-network-api

## Description
This application is an API for a social network web application where users can share thoughts, react to friends thoughts, and create a friends list. 

## Installation

The models folder holds the models and schemas. The routes folder holds javascript files for the routes, and the controller holds the java script files to handle the controller of the routes. To run this application, the following dependencies must be installed: mongoose, express and nodemon. 

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, the application will launch after entering "npm start" into the command line of the terminal. The applications routes will be tested in Insomnia. A video demonstration of the routes being tested is included below.
